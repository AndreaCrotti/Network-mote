Alpha - An Adaptive Lightweight Protocol for Hop-by-hop Authentication


SYNOPSIS
--------
'alpha' [-a] [-d] [-c config] [-l length] [-n n:c:m]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
An Adaptive Lightweight Protocol for Hop-by-hop Authentication, Alpha is a 
protocol for hop-wise integrity checking of packets and transparent 
communication mechanims. Alpha is targeted at small mobile devices which need 
to be protected against malicious users sending large amounts of forged or 
altered traffic to incapacitate the end-host.


OPTIONS
-------

:alpha: 1

-a::
	auto-configure routing for known hosts

-d::
	run alpha daemonized

-c <config>::	
	use config-file (overrides files found in . or /etc)

DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS
-------------------

-l <length>::
	use hash chains of this length (default 10000)

-n <n:c:m>::
	start this many alpha-n/c/m connections (outgoing) per client

FILES
-----
/etc/alpha.conf::
	default location for alpha-config
