* First meeting
  - ask for motes available
    At least two motes to attach to the usb ports and two virtual machines are needed (or one with two modules)
  - ask for what code is already available in the testbed

* Hints
  - try to use TUN/TAP drivers
  - see how to send packets over the network, see 6lowpan for examples
  - check the routing protocols already present in tinyos evaluating what's best to do
